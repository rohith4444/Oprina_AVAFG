# End-to-End Testing Summary

## What We've Done

We've created a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for the Oprina application. Here's what we've accomplished:

1. **Updated Voice Workflow Tests** (`test_voice_workflows.py`)
   - Added test functions for email, calendar, content, and complex multi-agent workflows
   - Implemented error handling tests
   - Ensured proper mocking of dependencies

2. **Created ADK Web Interface Tests** (`test_adk_web.py`)
   - Implemented tests for web startup, agent interaction, session management, and error handling
   - Used FastAPI's TestClient for testing the web interface
   - Ensured proper mocking of dependencies

3. **Created Test Data** (`test_data.py`)
   - Added sample session data, audio data, email content, calendar events, and content for summarization
   - Added sample voice commands and MCP client responses
   - Ensured data is in the correct format for testing

4. **Created Test Runner Scripts**
   - Python script (`run_tests.py`) for running tests with proper setup and reporting
   - Windows batch file (`run_tests.bat`) for running tests on Windows
   - Shell script (`run_tests.sh`) for running tests on Unix-like systems

5. **Created Documentation**
   - Test plan (`TEST_PLAN.md`) outlining the testing strategy
   - README (`README.md`) with instructions on how to run the tests
   - Summary (`SUMMARY.md`) of what we've done

## How to Run the Tests

### On Windows

```bash
# Run all tests
tests\e2e\run_tests.bat

# Run specific test files
tests\e2e\run_tests.bat --files tests\e2e\test_voice_workflows.py tests\e2e\test_adk_web.py

# Run specific test cases
tests\e2e\run_tests.bat --cases tests\e2e\test_voice_workflows.py::TestVoiceWorkflows::test_voice_email_workflow

# Run tests in verbose mode
tests\e2e\run_tests.bat --verbose
```

### On Unix-like Systems

```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/e2e/run_tests.sh

# Run specific test files
./tests/e2e/run_tests.sh --files tests/e2e/test_voice_workflows.py tests/e2e/test_adk_web.py

# Run specific test cases
./tests/e2e/run_tests.sh --cases tests/e2e/test_voice_workflows.py::TestVoiceWorkflows::test_voice_email_workflow

# Run tests in verbose mode
./tests/e2e/run_tests.sh --verbose
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Tests**: Run the tests to verify that they work correctly.
2. **Fix Any Issues**: Fix any issues that arise during testing.
3. **Add More Tests**: Add more tests to cover additional scenarios.
4. **Integrate with CI**: Integrate the tests with a continuous integration system.

## Conclusion

We've created a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for the Oprina application. This framework will help ensure that the application's components work together correctly in real-world scenarios. The tests are designed to be run in a continuous integration environment, and they include proper setup, reporting, and error handling.
